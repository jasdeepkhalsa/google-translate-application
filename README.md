# Google Translate Application
## Introduction
The Google Translate Application, originally developed for The Sikher Project (http://www.sikher.com), is a Java application that can translate large amounts of text rapidly through the Google Translate API. Most language pairs are supported, and as Google Translate begins to support more language pairs, they can easily be added via XML to this application.
